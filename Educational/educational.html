        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Disease, any harmful deviation from the normal structural or functional state of an organism, generally associated with certain signs and symptoms and differing in nature from physical injury</p>
        
        <p>There are a number of diseases that are common. While some of these diseases may be mild and not cause too much discomfort, others can be more serious. It is important to be aware of the symptoms of these diseases and to seek treatment if necessary. Many common health conditions can be prevented, diagnosed, and managed through routine screening and lab testing. The more you know about your health, the easier it is to be in control of it. In this blog post, we will highlight some of the most common diseases.</p>
        <h3>Some of the common dieases are:</h3>

            <h3>Diabetes</h3>
            <img src="Diabetes.jpg" alt="Diabetes The slow poisner"  class="responsive" height="520px" width="780px">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.</p>
            <h4>Symptoms</h4>
            <p>Symptoms of diabetes may occur suddenly. In type 2 diabetes, the symptoms can be mild and may take many years to be noticed.</p>
            <p>Symptoms of diabetes include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>feeling very thirsty</li>
                <li>blurred vision</li>
                <li>feeling tired</li>
                <li>losing weight unintentionally</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many people with diabetes develop problems with their feet from nerve damage and poor blood flow. This can cause foot ulcers and may lead to amputation.</p>
            <h4>Type 1 Diabetes</h4>
            <p>Type 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin. In 2017 there were 9 million people with type 1 diabetes; the majority of them live in high-income countries. Neither its cause nor the means to prevent it are known.</p>
            <h4>Type 2 Diabetes</h4>
            <p>ype 2 diabetes affects how your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy. It stops the body from using insulin properly, which can lead to high levels of blood sugar if not treated.

                Over time, type 2 diabetes can cause serious damage to the body, especially nerves and blood vessels.
                
                Type 2 diabetes is often preventable. Factors that contribute to developing type 2 diabetes include being overweight, not getting enough exercise, and genetics.</p>
                <h4>Prevention</h4>
                <p>Lifestyle changes are the best way to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.To help prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>each and keep a health body weight</li>
                    <li>stay physically active with at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise each day</li>
                    <li>not smoke tobacco.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="Dengue">
           <h3>Dengue</h3>
            <img src="Dengue.jpg" alt="Dengue Mosquito"  class="responsive" height="520px" width="580px">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>Dengue (break-bone fever) is a viral infection that spreads from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in tropical and subtropical climates. <br></p><p>Most people who get dengue won’t have symptoms. But for those that do, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and rash. Most will also get better in 1–2 weeks. Some people develop severe dengue and need care in a hospital.&nbsp;<br></p>
                <h4>Symptoms</h4>
                <p>Most people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in 1–2 weeks. Rarely, dengue can be severe and lead to death. &nbsp; </p>
                <p>If symptoms occur, they usually begin 4–10 days after infection and last for 2–7 days. Symptoms may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>high fever (40°C/104°F)</li>
                    <li>severe headache</li>
                    <li>pain behind the eyes</li>
                    <li>muscle and joint pains</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Diagnostics and treatment</h4>
                <p>Most cases of dengue fever can be treated at home with pain medicine. Preventing mosquito bites is the best way to avoid getting dengue. 
                </p>
                <p>There is no specific treatment for dengue. The focus is on treating pain symptoms.<br></p>
                <p>Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is often used to control pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and aspirin are avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding.<br></p>
                <p>There is a vaccine called Dengvaxia for people who have had dengue at least once and live in places where the disease is common.<br></p>
                <p>For people with severe dengue, hospitalization is often needed. </p>

            <h3>Flu</h3>
            <img src="Flu.jpg" alt="Flu" class="responsive" height="520px" width="580px"  >
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Flu is a respiratory illness that spreads from person to person. It can cause mild to severe illness. Serious outcomes of flu can result in hospitalization or to stay at home.Flu is caused by a virus that is spread from person to person. It causes seasonal epidemics each year.</p>
            <h4>Symptoms</h4>
            <p>Flu symptoms can occur suddenly. You might have the flu if you have some or all of these symptoms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fever</li>
                <li>Cough</li>
                <li>Fatigue</li>
                <li>headache</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Complications</h4>
        <p>Most people who get flu will recover in a few days to less than two weeks. But some people will develop complications (such as pneumonia) as a result of flu, some of which can be life-threatening and result in death.</p>
        <p>Possible serious complications triggered by flu can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lung infection (pneumonia)</li>
            <li>Inflammation of the heart, brain, or muscle</li>
            <li>Sepsis, which can be deadly</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Treatment</h4>
        <p>Your doctor might prescribe antivirals drugs for flu. These drugs can make you better faster and may also prevent serious complications.</p>
        
        <p>

            If you are in a high-risk group and develop flu symptoms, you need to contact your doctor when you first notice flu symptoms. Remind them about your high-risk status for flu. See Treatment – Antiviral Drugs for more information</p>

            <h3>Skin-Problems</h3>
            <img src="Skin.jpg" alt="Skin Dieases" class="responsive" height="520px" width="580px" >
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Skin infections occur when bacteria infect the skin and sometimes the deep tissue beneath the skin. Cellulitis is a common type of skin infection that causes redness, swelling, and pain in the infected area of the skin.</p>
            <p>
                Another type of skin infection is skin abscess, which is a collection of pus under the skin.</p>
          <p> Normally, different types of bacteria live on a person’s skin. Cellulitis or abscess can occur if there is a cut or a break in the skin that allows bacteria to enter and cause an infection.  </p>
          <h4>Risk Factors</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Injury to the skin</li>
            <li>Skin conditions, such as athlete’s foot or eczema</li>
            <li>Chronic swelling of the legs or arms</li>
            <li>Diabetes</li>
          </ul>
       <h4>Symptoms</h4>
       <p>Symptoms of cellulitis can come on gradually or suddenly and include:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Skin redness</li>
        <li>Pain, tenderness, or warmth when the affected skin is touched</li>
        <li>Swelling of the affected area</li>
       </ul>
       <h4>Treatment</h4>
       <p>Your doctor will determine if you have a skin infection by asking about symptoms and doing a physical examination.</p>
       <p>Antibiotics are needed to treat cellulitis.</p>
       <p>If you have a skin abscess, your doctor may need to drain the pus from the abscess. Antibiotics are sometimes needed for abscesses after the pus has been drained.</p>

            <h3>Sore-Throat</h3>
            <img src="young-woman-with-sore-throat.jpg" alt="sore-throat" class="responsive" height="520px" width="580px" >
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>A sore throat can make it painful to swallow. A sore throat can also feel dry and scratchy. Sore throat can be a symptom of strep throat, the common cold, allergies, or other upper respiratory tract illness.</p>
            <h4>Symptoms</h4>
            <p>A sore throat can make it painful to swallow. A sore throat can also feel dry and scratchy. Sore throat can be a symptom of strep throat, the common cold, allergies, or other upper respiratory tract illness. Sore throat caused by a virus or the bacteria called group A Streptococcus can have similar symptoms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cough</li>
                <li>Runny nose</li>
                <li>Hoarseness (changes in your voice that makes it sound breathy, raspy, or strained)</li>
                <li>Conjunctivitis (also called pink eye)</li>
                <li>Red and swollen tonsils</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Treatment</h4>
            <p>A doctor will determine what type of illness you have by asking about symptoms and doing a physical examination. Sometimes they will also swab your throat.</p>
            <p>Since bacteria cause strep throat, antibiotics are needed to treat the infection and prevent rheumatic fever and other complications. A doctor cannot tell if someone has strep throat just by looking in the throat. If your doctor thinks you might have strep throat, they can test you to determine if it is causing your illness.</p>
            <p>Anyone with strep throat should stay home from work, school, or daycare until they no longer have fever AND have taken antibiotics for at least 12 hours.</p>

        <div class="Ear-Infection">
            <h3>Ear-Infection</h3>
            <img src="EarInfection.jpg" alt="Ear-Infection" class="responsive" height="520px" width="580px">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>There are different types of ear infections. Middle ear infection (acute otitis media) is an infection in the middle ear.</p>
              <p>
                Another condition that affects the middle ear is called otitis media with effusion. This condition occurs when fluid builds up in the middle ear without causing an infection. Otitis media with effusion does not cause fever, ear pain, or pus build-up in the middle ear</p>
            <p>Bacteria or viruses can cause a middle ear infection: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bacteria, like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (nontypeable) are the two most common bacteria causing middle ear infection</li>
                <li>Viruses, like those that cause colds can cause middle ear infection</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Symptoms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ear pain</li>
                <li>Fever</li>
                <li>Fussiness or irritability</li>
                <li>Difficulty sleeping</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Treatment</h4>
            <p>A doctor can diagnose a middle ear infection by asking about symptoms and examining your child. The doctor will look inside your child’s ear to examine the eardrum and look for pus in the middle ear.

                The body’s immune system can often fight off middle ear infection on its own. Antibiotics are sometimes not needed for middle ear infections. However, severe middle ear infections or infections that last longer than 2–3 days need antibiotics right away.
                
                For mild middle ear infection, your doctor might recommend watchful waiting or delayed antibiotic prescribing.</p>

            <img src="uniary.jpg" alt="Uniary Diease"  class="responsive" width="580px" height="520px" >
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>UTIs are common infections that happen when bacteria, often from the skin or rectum, enter the urethra, and infect the urinary tract. The infections can affect several parts of the urinary tract, but the most common type is a bladder infection (cystitis).</p>
            <h4>Symptoms</h4>
            <p>Symptoms of a bladder infection can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pain or burning while urinating</li>
                <li>Frequent urination</li>
                <li>Feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder</li>
                <li>Bloody urine</li>
                <li>Pressure or cramping in the groin or lower abdomen</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Younger children may not be able to tell you about UTI symptoms they are having. While fever is the most common sign of UTI in infants and toddlers, most children with fever do not have a UTI. If you have concerns that your child may have a UTI, talk to a healthcare professional.</p>
            <h4>Treatment</h4>
            <p>Your healthcare professional will determine if you have a UTI by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Asking about symptoms</li>
                <li>Doing a physical exam</li>
                <li>Ordering urine tests, if needed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Bacteria cause UTIs and antibiotics treat them. However, any time you take antibiotics, they can cause side effects. Side effects can include rash, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, and yeast infections. More serious side effects can include antibiotic-resistant infections or C. diff infection, which causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death. Call your healthcare professional if you develop any side effects while taking your antibiotic.</p>

        <div class="Acidity">
            <h3>Acidity</h3>
            <img src="Acidity.jpg" alt="Acidity" class="responsive" height="520px" width="580px" >
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Acidity is one of the most common ailments that almost everyone experiences once in their lifetimes. In simple terms, it is a condition that causes excess acid production in the stomach. This not only causes discomfort in the stomach but also leads to other symptoms, such as a sour taste in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, and indigestion. </p>
            <p>There are numerous causes of acidity, right from poor eating habits and excessive stress to the use of certain medications. Moreover, lifestyle factors, such as smoking and consuming foods loaded with oil, fats, and spices, can also up your risk of acidity. </p>
            <p>The causes are</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eating foods containing excessive amounts of chillies, pepper, vinegar, and paprika</li>
                <li>Overeating or eating at irregular intervals</li>
                <li>Excessive intake of alcohol, soda, or carbonated drinks</li>
                <li>Frequent smoking</li>
                <li>Excessive stress, anxiety, or depression</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Symptoms</h4>
            <p>The symptoms of acidity occur when some of the acid content of the stomach flows back up into the esophagus or the food pipe, which connects the mouth to the stomach. Normally, a ring of muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) acts as a valve that lets food enter the stomach but does not allow it back up into the esophagus. When this valve fails to function properly, stomach contents are regurgitated into the esophagus and the following symptoms of acidity can be experienced:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Heartburn
                    <p>It is a common symptom of acidity that is caused when the excess stomach acid leaks out into the esophagus, leading to a burning sensation in the chest. </p>
                </li>
                <li>2. Regurgitation
                    <p> It is a feeling in which the person may feel liquid undigested food, bile, or stomach acid moving up and down in the throat. This sensation is somewhat similar to the feeling of being pukish and usually occurs post meals, exercising, or bending right after eating.</p>
                </li>
                <li>3. Sour taste in the mouth
                    <p>Another common symptom of stomach ailments, a sour taste in the mouth, is also a symptom of acidity. It happens when food, along with stomach acid and bile, rises up to the back of your throat, causing a bitter taste. This usually happens along with regurgitation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>4. Difficulty in swallowing
                    <p>Difficulty in swallowing, also known as dysphagia, happens when excess acid in the stomach causes a feeling of fullness. It also causes a delay in the movement of food through the food pipe and impedes digestion.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Treatment</h4>
            <p>If you experience any symptoms of acidity, such as burning pain or discomfort (also called heartburn), regurgitation or bloating or burping (with a sour taste in the mouth), then it is wise to consult a doctor. Your doctor might do some physical examination followed by a few questions related to your daily routine to know the cause of it.</p>
            <p>If your symptoms are mild, your doctor might not recommend any tests. However, if your symptoms fail to show any improvement post-treatment or if you experience symptoms such as internal bleeding or difficulty in swallowing, then your doctor might recommend further investigation.</p>
